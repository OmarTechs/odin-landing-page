My Second Project in odin foundation 

Learned alot in the foundation journey on how 
to use css in creating a website. How to style them and ajust thier position with flexbox.
I feel there is still alot to improve in this project so I need to learn more how make my second project more advanced.

I ready for more challenges ahead and will come back to change my second project in the future after gaining more skills from this project.
